One of the blessings of Vimers is that many other editors or IDEs have a vim mode or a vim plugin. VSCode users, for example, can enjoy the Vim mode by installing a plugin called VSCodeVim.  I have been using it for a while and I am quite satisfied with it. You can definitely build up an IDE only using the authentic Vim with a few Vim plugins as I did before but VSCode with VSCodeVim makes my life much easier. 

I used to think that VSCodeVim is barely a Vim emulator for VSCode as the official slogan reads. However, I found that it is much more than that. VSCodeVim also integrate many popular vim plugins. We can use `vim-surround` and `vim-commentary` off the shelf, and we can also enjoy `vim-easymotion` and `vim-sneak` by checking their enable boxes.
