Stack Overflow has been carrying out an annual developer survey since 2011. [Datasets](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/?_ga=2.4656628.677002830.1676555026-674836096.1676555026) in CSV files can be downloaded for your own purpose.

I'm interested in the most popular languages for developers. So I do the statistics based on the 2022 dataset. Here's the top-10 result.

We can also do the statistics based on the developer type. Here are results for "Data or Business Analyst" and "Data Scientist or Machine Learning Specialist".
