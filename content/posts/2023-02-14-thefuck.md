[`The Fuck`](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) is a brilliant command line tool, which is both funny and useful.

I installed `The Fuck` on my Macbook today because I somehow misspelled `commit` as `commmit` several times, and I found something even more interesting.

First, I got `The Fuck` by `brew`

    brew install thefuck

Things went along well except that `thefuck` came along with many dependencies, so it took a long time to download, but that's fine.

Then, I ran the `git commmit` command again to test whether `thefuck` worked on my computer. However, it showed

It turned out that you have to run the `rc` file or restart your shell.

FUCK!
