## What are "Breadcrumbs"?

Web developers often use breadcrumbs to show the current page's location within a navigational hierarchy. For example, at the top of this page appear the breadcrumbs of "Home>>Posts". This is implemented by adding the following line to the `config.yml` file.

    showBreadCrumbs: true

## Why Breadcrumbs are Called Breadcrumbs?
In the fairy tale [*Hansel and Gretel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel), breadcrumbs are used by Hansel and Gretel to track their footpath. The popularity of breadcrumbs in the fairy tale led to the use of the word "breadcrumb" as a navigation element that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents[^1].
